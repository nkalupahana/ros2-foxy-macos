# macOS ROS2 (Foxy) Build Packaging

This project aims to use CI to automatically build and package ROS2 Foxy for macOS. This is already done for Ubuntu (all packages on apt) and [Windows (on Azure Pipelines)](https://ros-win.visualstudio.com/ros-win/_build), but there's just no good alternative for macOS.
